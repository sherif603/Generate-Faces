# Generate-Faces
Under the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program, the fifth project, Generate Faces.
In this project, I defined and trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on a dataset of faces, the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA). This project aims to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.
•	Generate new faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
•	A GAN is comprised of two adversarial networks, a discriminator and a generator.
•	Initialize the weights of the networks.
•	Define the model hyperparameters.
•	Training on GPU.
•	Define the discriminator and generator loss functions.
•	Define the optimizers for the discriminator and the generator.
